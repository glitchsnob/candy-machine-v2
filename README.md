# Candy Machine V2 Frontend

This is a barebones implementation of Candy Machine V2 frontend, intended for users who want to quickly get started selling Solana NFT's. It DOES NOT include captcha yet - we plan to make this feature available in a future release. Some code has been ported from the Fair Launch Protocol frontend in the Metaplex repo. This has been tested with candy machine programs on both devnet and mainnet-beta.

The app was built using Svelte + Vite and uses TailwindCSS for styles.


Built and customized using this frontend.
